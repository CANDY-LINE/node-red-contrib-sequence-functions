There are 3 nodes in this project.

1. `capture` node ... Capture and store data under the given conditions
1. `map` node ... Provide `map` function
1. `filter` node ... Provide `filter` function

These functions are expected to be used with [`node-red-contrib-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-cache) and [`node-red-contrib-statistics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-statistics) nodes for better event processing functionalities.
