Sequence processing function Node-RED nodes including `map`, `reduce` and `filter`.

There are 4 nodes in this project.

1. `capture` node ... Capture and store data under the given conditions
1. `map` node ... Provide `map` function
1. `reduce` node ... Provide `reduce` function
1. `filter` node ... Provide `filter` function

These functions are useful when you process and evaluate the event message stream on Node-RED in conjunction with [`node-red-contrib-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-cache) and [`node-red-contrib-statistics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-statistics).

### Installation

```
cd ~\.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-sequence-functions
```
